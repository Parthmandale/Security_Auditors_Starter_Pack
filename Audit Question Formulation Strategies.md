# Audit Question Formulation Strategies

Here are some strategies for coming up with questions and considerations to thoroughly audit the security of a smart contract:

1.  **Code Review and Structure:**
    
    - What is the purpose of this smart contract?
    - Are there any unnecessary functions or variables?
    - Are there any unused variables or functions?
    - Is the code well-documented and easy to understand?
    - Are external dependencies properly vetted and secure?
    - Does the contract adhere to established coding standards (e.g., Solidity best practices)?
    - What are some assumptions in the system?
    - What are some of the mechanism common to more than one user and depended on by all users?
    - What parts of the system have standards? e.g. token standards, upgradability standards, services provided standards
    - How well are the listed standards followed?
2.  **Access Control:**
    
    - Who has access to privileged functions or data?
    - Are access control mechanisms properly implemented?
    - Are there any potential vulnerabilities related to access control (e.g., missing `onlyOwner` modifiers)?
    - Are default visibility settings used effectively?
3.  **Input Validation and Safety:**
    
    - Are input parameters validated properly?
    - What are some assumptions in the system?
    - Are there any potential integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities?
    - Are input values checked for overflows, underflows, or unexpected edge cases?
    - Are external calls or delegate calls properly validated and handled?
4.  **State Management and Reentrancy:**
    
    - How is the state managed and updated within the contract?
    - Are there any reentrancy vulnerabilities?
    - Are state transitions and storage operations performed safely?
    - Are there any potential race conditions?
5.  **Gas Costs and Limits:**
    
    - Are gas costs properly estimated?
    - Could gas limits be exceeded under certain conditions?
    - Are gas refunds handled correctly?
    - Are loops and iterations within acceptable gas limits?
6.  **External Dependencies and Contracts:**
    
    - Are external contracts and libraries secure and up to date?
    - Are there potential risks associated with interacting with external contracts?
    - Have potential reentrancy issues with external calls been addressed?
7.  **Token and Asset Handling:**
    
    - How can a malicious or untrusted token affect this contract?
    - How does the contract handle unexpected or malicious input from tokens?
    - Are there safeguards in place to prevent malicious tokens from interacting with the contract?
    - What are the potential risks associated with accepting tokens from untrusted sources?
    - Does the contract rely on token approvals and allowances from external addresses?
    - Are there vulnerabilities related to unauthorized token allowances?
    - How does the contract handle changes in token approval status or token balances?
    - Can the contract be exploited through front-running attacks when interacting with tokens?
    - Are there measures in place to mitigate the risks of front-running when processing token transactions?
    - Are there potential reentrancy vulnerabilities when interacting with tokens?
    - How does the contract prevent reentrancy attacks from malicious tokens?
    - Are withdrawal patterns and interactions with tokens secure?
    - Is the contract compatible with common token standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721)?
    - Are there potential compatibility issues or vulnerabilities when interacting with different token standards?
    - Are there any functions within the contract triggered by token transfers?
    - How does the contract ensure that token-triggered functions are secure and cannot be abused?
    - Can malicious tokens manipulate their value or behavior in a way that negatively impacts the contract?
    - Are there checks in place to detect and handle tokens with unexpected behaviors?
    - How does the contract handle token upgrades or migrations to a new token contract?
    - Are there security measures to prevent disruptions during token transitions?
    - Does the contract follow best practices for interacting with tokens, such as checking return values and handling edge cases?
    - Are token interactions well-documented and reviewed for security concerns?
8.  **Monitoring, Alerts, and Incident Handling:**
    
    - Is there a monitoring system in place to detect suspicious token-related activities?
    - Are there mechanisms for alerting and responding to potential token-related security incidents?
9.  **User Education and Compliance:**
    
    - Are users informed about the risks associated with interacting with the contract using tokens?
    - Is there educational material or guidance on safely using tokens with the contract?
    - Does the smart contract comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements?
    - Are there any issues related to data privacy and user consent?
10. **Community and Peer Review:**
    
    - Have you sought feedback from the blockchain community and peers?
    - Are there any known security concerns raised by the community?
11. **Future Considerations:**
    
    - Is the contract designed to be upgradeable, and if so, is the upgrade process secure?
    - How will the contract handle future changes to the blockchain protocol or dependencies?
12. **Documentation and User Education:**
    
    - Are users of the contract provided with clear documentation on its functionality and security considerations?

This comprehensive list covers a wide range of security considerations for auditing a smart contract, including both general contract security and specific aspects related to token interactions.
